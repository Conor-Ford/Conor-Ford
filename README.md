Hi, I'm Conor.

I am a Physics Master's graduate from the University of Groningen, NL; I graduated in 2025. I completed my Bachelor's degree of Physics and Philosophy Joint Honours at the University of Nottingham, UK, graduating in June 2023.

During my Master's I worked on the XENONnT experiment through the XENON collaboration and the Nikhef Institute in Amsterdam. My thesis was entitled, "Modelling Delayed Electron
Emission in XENONnT". The work on this project can be found in my "Masters-Project" repository.

More to be added here I guess, watch this space?
