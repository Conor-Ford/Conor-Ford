Hi, I'm Conor.

I am a Master's Physics student currently studying at the University of Groningen, NL. I completed my Bachelor's degree of Physics and Philosophy Joint Honours at the University of Nottingham, UK, having graduated in June 2023.

I am currently working on a research project with the XENON collaboration in conjunction with Nikhef institute, more details of which can presumably be found in some other respository (tbc).

More to be added here I guess, watch this space?
